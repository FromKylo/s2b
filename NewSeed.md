# Speech to Braille Application Processes

## Application Architecture

The Speech to Braille application is built as a modular JavaScript application that converts spoken words into braille patterns and can optionally output them to a physical braille display via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

## Core Components

### 1. Main Application Controller (SpeechToBrailleApp)

The main application class that coordinates all modules and manages the application flow.

- **Initialization Sequence**
  - Sets up core components and UI elements
  - Checks for mobile devices and creates appropriate UI
  - Initializes BLE, debugging, and output modules
  - Sets up speech recognition callbacks
  - Checks microphone permissions

- **Phase Management**
  - Introduction Phase: Initial welcome and setup
  - Permission Phase: Request microphone access
  - Recording Phase: Listen for speech input
  - Output Phase: Display and send braille patterns

- **Event Handling**
  - Manages UI interaction events
  - Handles press-to-talk functionality for mobile devices
  - Processes speech recognition results
  - Manages transitions between application phases

### 2. Speech Recognition Module

Handles voice input processing and word detection.

- **Voice Processing**
  - Captures audio input from microphone
  - Processes speech using Web Speech API
  - Detects individual words and calculates confidence levels
  - Provides interim and final recognition results

- **Permission Management**
  - Requests microphone access
  - Handles permission state changes
  - Provides feedback on permission status

### 3. Braille Translation Module

Converts recognized text to braille patterns.

- **Pattern Matching**
  - Looks up words in braille database
  - Returns appropriate braille dot patterns
  - Handles different braille languages/codes

- **Pattern Rendering**
  - Creates visual representation of braille patterns
  - Formats patterns for physical braille display

### 4. BLE Communication

Manages connection to physical braille display devices.

- **Device Connection**
  - Discovers and connects to BLE devices
  - Maintains connection state
  - Provides connection status feedback

- **Data Transmission**
  - Sends braille patterns to connected device
  - Formats data according to device protocol
  - Verifies successful transmission

### 5. User Interface Components

Manages the visual interface and user interaction.

- **Mobile-specific UI**
  - Press-to-talk button for speech input
  - Audio level visualization
  - Network status indicators

- **Responsive Design**
  - Adapts to different device types
  - Provides appropriate interaction methods

- **Feedback Mechanisms**
  - Visual indication of application state
  - Animation for audio input
  - Word detection feedback

### 6. Debug and Development Tools

Provides tools for testing and debugging.

- **Debug Console**
  - Logs application events with timestamps
  - Command interface for testing features
  - Displays detailed state information

- **Testing Functions**
  - Braille pattern test sequences
  - Connection testing utilities
  - Simulation capabilities

## Data Flow

1. **Speech Input** → User speaks or presses talk button
2. **Speech Recognition** → Audio is converted to text
3. **Word Detection** → Individual words are extracted
4. **Braille Translation** → Words are matched to braille patterns
5. **Visual Rendering** → Patterns are displayed on screen
6. **BLE Transmission** → Patterns are sent to physical device

## Error Handling

- Microphone permission denial
- Network connectivity issues
- Word recognition failures
- Device connection problems
- Database loading errors

## User Experience Considerations

- Provides clear feedback on application state
- Adapts to different device capabilities
- Offers appropriate input methods for device type
- Gives visual confirmation when words are recognized
- Allows manual control of phase transitions
